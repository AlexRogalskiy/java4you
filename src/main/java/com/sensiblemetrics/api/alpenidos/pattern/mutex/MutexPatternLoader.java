/**
 * A Mutex prevents multiple threads from accessing a resource simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * In this example we have two thieves who are taking beans from a jar.
 * Only one thief can take a bean at a time. This is ensured by a Mutex lock
 * which must be acquired in order to access the jar. Each thief attempts to
 * acquire the lock, take a bean and then release the lock. If the lock has
 * already been acquired, the thief will be prevented from continuing (blocked)
 * until the lock has been released. The thieves stop taking beans once there
 * are no beans left to take.
