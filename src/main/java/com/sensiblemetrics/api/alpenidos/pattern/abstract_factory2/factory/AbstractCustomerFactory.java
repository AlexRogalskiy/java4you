/**
 * This is the Abstract Factory class providing operations that all concrete factory classes must override and implement to build stuff.
 * <p>
 * Yes, this could have been an interface, but the 'abstract class' bit clearly shows we're using the Abstract Factory pattern for the demo here.
 * <p>
 * The Abstract Factory provides the operations for building the family of parts that make up a Customer.
 * <p>
 * One thing to note, the Abstract Factory pattern does <em>not</em> create an actual Customer object; it only creates the (family of) parts that make it up.
