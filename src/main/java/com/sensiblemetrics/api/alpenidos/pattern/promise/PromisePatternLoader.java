/**
 * The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation
 * that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.
 *
 * <p>A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It
 * allows you to associate dependent promises to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or
 * failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead
 * of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point
 * in the future.
 *
 * <p>Promises provide a few advantages over callback objects:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Functional composition and error handling
 * <li> Prevents callback hell and provides callback aggregation
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this application the usage of promise is demonstrated with two examples:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Count Lines: In this example a file is downloaded and its line count is calculated.
 * The calculated line count is then consumed and printed on console.
 * <li>Lowest Character Frequency: In this example a file is downloaded and its lowest frequency
 * character is found and printed on console. This happens via a chain of promises, we start with
 * a file download promise, then a promise of character frequency, then a promise of lowest frequency
 * character which is finally consumed and result is printed on console.
 * </ul>
