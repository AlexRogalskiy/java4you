 * The Execute Around idiom specifies some code to be executed before and after a method. Typically

 * allocation/deallocation or lock acquisition/release.
 * <p>
 * In this example, we have {@link SimpleFileWriter} class that opens and closes the file for the
 * user. The user specifies only what to do with the file by providing the {@link FileWriterAction}
 * implementation.
