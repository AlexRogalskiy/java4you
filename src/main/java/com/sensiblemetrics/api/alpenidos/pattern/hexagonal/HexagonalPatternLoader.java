/**
 * Hexagonal Architecture pattern decouples the application core from the
 * services it uses. This allows the services to be plugged in and the
 * application will run with or without the services.<p>
 * <p>
 * The core logic, or business logic, of an application consists of the
 * algorithms that are essential to its purpose. They implement the use
 * cases that are the heart of the application. When you change them, you
 * change the essence of the application.<p>
 * <p>
 * The services are not essential. They can be replaced without changing
 * the purpose of the application. Examples: database access and other
 * types of storage, user interface components, e-mail and other
 * communication components, hardware devices.<p>
 * <p>
 * This example demonstrates Hexagonal Architecture with a lottery system.
 * The application core is separate from the services that drive it and
 * from the services it uses.<p>
 * <p>
 * The primary ports for the application are console interfaces
 * {@link ConsoleAdministration} through which the lottery round is
 * initiated and run and {@link ConsoleLottery} that allows players to
 * submit lottery tickets for the draw.<p>
 * <p>
 * The secondary ports that application core uses are {@link WireTransfers}
 * which is a banking service, {@link LotteryEventLog} that delivers
 * eventlog as lottery events occur and {@link LotteryTicketRepository}
 * that is the storage for the lottery tickets.
