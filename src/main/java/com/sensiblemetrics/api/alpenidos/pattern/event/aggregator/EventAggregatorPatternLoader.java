/**
 * A system with lots of objects can lead to complexities when a client wants to subscribe to
 * events. The client has to find and register for each object individually, if each object has
 * multiple events then each event requires a separate subscription.
 * <p>
 * An Event Aggregator acts as a single source of events for many objects. It registers for all the
 * events of the many objects allowing clients to register with just the aggregator.
 * <p>
 * In the example {@link LordBaelish}, {@link LordVarys} and {@link Scout} deliver events to
 * {@link KingsHand}. {@link KingsHand}, the event aggregator, then delivers the events to
 * {@link KingJoffrey}.
