/**
 * Imperative-style programming to iterate over the list and get the names of
 * cars made later than the year 2000. We then sort the models in ascending
 * order by year.
 *
 * <p>As you can see, there's a lot of looping in this code. First, the
 * getModelsAfter2000UsingFor method takes a list of cars as its parameter. It
 * extracts or filters out cars made after the year 2000, putting them into a
 * new list named carsSortedByYear. Next, it sorts that list in ascending order
 * by year-of-make. Finally, it loops through the list carsSortedByYear to get
 * the model names and returns them in a list.
 *
 * <p>This short example demonstrates what I call the effect of statements. While
 * functions and methods in general can be used as expressions, the {@link Collections}
 * sort method doesn't return a result. Because it is used as a statement, it
 * mutates the list given as argument. Both of the for loops also mutate lists
 * as they iterate. Being statements, that's just how these elements work. As a
 * result, the code contains unnecessary garbage variables
